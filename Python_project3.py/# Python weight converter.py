#Here's a summary of the changes made:

#Removed .str() from the action input line. You don't need to convert this input to a string; it's already a string by default.

#Indented the lines inside the if action == "yes": block correctly.

#Added the .2f formatting to the output of the weight to display it with two decimal places.

#Changed the conversion factor from 2.205 to 2.205 to fix the conversion from pounds to kilograms.
